✅ What is Time Series Analysis?

Time Series Analysis is a way to study data that is collected over time — for example, sales every day, week, or month.

🔹 It helps you understand patterns like:

Trends (sales going up or down over time),

Seasonality (sales go up in December every year),

Cycles (sales go up/down every few years),

Noise (random ups and downs).

📌 Example:
If you look at your store’s sales for the past 12 months, time series analysis helps you see:

Are sales increasing?

Are there peak months?

Are there regular ups and downs?

✅ What is Sales Forecasting?

Sales Forecasting means predicting future sales using past sales data.

🔹 We use time series analysis to understand the past, and then use that understanding to forecast future sales.

📌 Example:
If you know your sales always increase in November and December, you can forecast that this year too, you’ll have higher sales in those months.


✅ What is KPI? (in Easy Words)

KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator.

It is a number or measurement that tells you how well something is working.

🔹 Simple Definition:

A KPI is a way to measure success.

📌 It helps you track progress toward a goal.

🧠 In Very Simple Words:

KPI = Important Score

It shows if you’re doing good or bad in a certain area.

🔧 Examples of KPIs:

Area	KPI Example	What It Means

Business	Monthly Sales = ₹500,000	Measures how much you’re selling
Website	Website Visitors = 20,000	Shows how many people visit your site
Customer Service	Response Time = 2 hours	Measures how quickly you reply to customers
Health	Steps per Day = 10,000	Tracks your physical activity

🛍️ Shop Example:

If you run a shop and want to know how well your business is doing, you can track KPIs like:

Daily Sales

Number of Customers

Profit Margin

Customer Satisfaction

These numbers help you understand what’s going well — and what needs improvement.

✅ Summary:

KPI = Important Number that Tracks Success

It helps you:

Stay focused

Measure progress

Improve performance

📌 Clustered Bar Chart – Key Points
Used to compare multiple values for each category.

Displays horizontal bars, grouped side by side.

Each group (cluster) represents one category (e.g., product, city).

Each bar inside the group represents a different series (e.g., year, gender).

Helps in comparing values across multiple categories and time periods.

Good for wide category names (horizontal layout fits better).

Best when you have 2 or more series per category.

✅ When to Use
Comparing sales, counts, or values across multiple years or groups.

Showing side-by-side comparison between categories.

When you want a horizontal layout (vs vertical column chart).

📌 Area Chart – Key Points for Notes
Used to show trends over time with a filled area below the line.

Shows how values increase or decrease across time (e.g., months, years).

Visually emphasizes the magnitude of change.

Better than line chart when you want to highlight volume.

✅ When to Use
When tracking growth or trend over time (e.g., website visitors, sales).

When you want to compare categories (use stacked area for this).

For continuous data like dates or time-based data.

📊 Types
Area Chart – Single series with area fill.

Stacked Area Chart – Multiple series stacked on each other to show part-to-whole over time.

🛠️ Setup in Power BI
X-axis: Time (e.g., Date, Month, Year)

Y-axis: Numeric values (e.g., Sales, Revenue)

Add Legend for multiple series (e.g., regions, products)
